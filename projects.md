This is my portfolio of major research projects. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments. 


### Research at Indian Space Research Organization
As a scientist at National Remote Sensing Center,ISRO, my major research interest includes deep learning, image processing, data analysis and natural language processing.
## Deep Learning
1. RTC-GAN: A novel generative adversarial network design for infusing spectral information into the spatial features for real time semantic LULC segmentation of satellite data [[**Published at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS'20**]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9323363)  
Summary: The goal of this project is to design a novel GAN architecture for real-time classification of satellite images.   
Technology Used: Python, Keras, Scipy, PIL, GDAL, RasterIO

2. DisMon-GAN: A 24x7, all-weather disaster monitoring tool for assisting ministries and rescue teams by providing seamless synthesised optical images from the information collected by microwave SAR data. [[**Under Review at Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)**]](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/)
Technology Used: Python, Keras, Scipy, PIL, GDAL, RasterIO

3. Land Use Land Cover Classification of Satellite Images using Deep Learning: This work discusses how high resolution satellite images are classified into various classes like cloud, vegetation, water and miscellaneous, using feed forward neural network.

Technology Used: Python, Keras, Scipy, PIL, GDAL, RasterIO

4. Thematic layer generation from Sentinel Images using M2TGAN: In this work, we generate the thematic maps from satellite images. Here, we generate water bodies thematic and use both traditional Autoencoder and a Generative Adversarial Network (M2TGAN). [**Source Code**](https://github.com/RohitGandikota/Satellite-Images-to-thematic-maps-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.)
Technology Used: Python, Keras, Scipy, PIL, GDAL, RasterIO

## Image Processing
1. Automatic Satellite Quality Data Evaluation Algorithms: Automatic Image Quality Analysis (AIQA) has become a very crucial module in remote sensing industry. With increasing competition and institutions that provide remote sensing images, the quality of images provided to the users has a huge impact. This work provides advanced quality parameters like noise density, histogram statistics, radiometry paramters, geometry parameters, and LULC thematic information. 
Technology Used: Python, Scipy, Sci-kit, Numba, PIL, GDAL, RasterIO

2.A Novel Approach for Pixel Dropouts Localization: Commonly known as salt and pepper noise in the image processing terminology, pixel dropouts can be detected with many existing algorithms that usually tend to falsely detect edges as noise. To overcome this common problem, a novel 2-stage algorithm has been designed to detect salt and pepper noise in raw satellite imagery. [[**Under Review at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS'22)**]](https://www.igarss2022.org/)
Technology Used: Python, Sci-kit, Numba , Scipy, PIL, GDAL, RasterIO

## Data Analysis
1. Data Mining of ISRO's production history and analysing the data for identifying gaps to improve efficiency. Formulated an optimization problem to improve the efficiency of production by considering dynamic resourceallocation problem in stochastic environment.  Recorded a 2.4 folds improvement in production time.
Tools used: Python, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Pandas, Oracle 

2. Analysis and Visualization of radiometry parameters automatically calculated for ~2000 images(512GB) per day to assess the quality and monitor the products delivered to users. 
Tools used: Python, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Pandas, Postgres 

## Natural Language Processing 
1. NLP solutions for automatic satellite ordering using voice search commands for ISROâ€™s open data websiteand provided an [API package for the same on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bhoonidhi/)

2. Developing speech recongition extension for satellite specific lingo. Using open-sourced pre-trained LSTM networks to fine-tune for satellite data specific jargons. 

3. API for bhoonidhi, ISRO's open data dissemination portal. [**Source Code**](https://github.com/RohitGandikota/BhoonidhiAPI)

### Research at Indian Space Research Organization
This is where my passion for machine learning was shaped into research. My work here mainly focused on basic understanding of deep learning architectures, their applications in computer vision applications (data hiding, image detection, autonomous vehicle vision, and face recognition) and a little bit of text processing and NLP.
