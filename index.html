<h2>Rohit Gandikota</h2>

I love to explore the concepts of Artificial Intelligence and their applications in Computer Vision. I've majored in Avionics from Indian Institute of Space science and Technology where I, along with few other students have founded the AI group of IIST. My final year thesis on developing deep generative model architectures for the applications in data hiding has been recognised by Indian National Academy of Engineering and was conferred with the "Best innovative computer science BTech thesis" award in India.

Currently working as a scientist/engineer at the Indian Space Research Organization, I'm responsible for developing deep learning solutions for satellite data applications. I'm also involved in advanced image processing techniques for the processing and evaluation of satellite images. Developed a smart interactive voice based search using NLP solutions for ordering of satellite data on isro open data portal, Bhoonidhi.

Published multiple research papers on novel deep learning architectures for various applications like data hiding, remote sensing, etc. Received a prestigious national award for work in data hiding. Received a full tuition scholarship by Department of Space, Govt. of India, for undergraduation.  

Experience:
6+ years in python programming
4+ years in deep learning and computer vision research
2 years at Intel as Student ambassador for AI program
2+ years at Indian Space Research Organisation

Python programming:
Keras, Tensorflow, SciKit, Scipy, PIL,  OpenCV, Plotly, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, Pyspark
