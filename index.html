I love to explore the concepts of Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Computer Vision. I have majored in Avionics from the Indian Institute of Space science and Technology, where I, along with a few other students, founded the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Club of IIST. My final year thesis on developing deep generative model architectures for the applications in data hiding has been recognized by the Indian National Academy of Engineering and was conferred with the "Best innovative computer science BTech thesis" award in India.

<p>
Currently working as a scientist/engineer at the Indian Space Research Organization, I am responsible for developing deep learning solutions for satellite data applications. I am also involved in advanced image processing techniques for processing and evaluating satellite images and developed a smart interactive voice-based search using NLP solutions for ordering satellite data on the ISRO's open data portal, Bhoonidhi.

<p>
Published multiple research papers on novel deep learning architectures for various applications like data hiding, remote sensing, etc. Received a prestigious national award for work in data hiding. Received a full tuition scholarship by Department of Space, Govt. of India, for undergraduation.
