I love to explore and understand the working of generative models in deep learning. I am a master's student at Khoury College of Computer Sciences majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am working with Prof. David Bau of Northeastern University and collaborating with Prof. Antonio Torralba group of MIT as a graduate researcher in the field of generative models. My research in diffusion models and GANs has been published at top ML conferences. 

I worked as a scientist at the Indian Space Research Organization, where my research was focused on applications of generative models in remote sensing. I was responsible for developing deep-learning solutions for satellite data applications. I am also involved in designing advanced image processing techniques to process and evaluate satellite images and developed a smart interactive voice-based search using NLP solutions for ordering satellite data on ISRO's open data portal, Bhoonidhi.

My bachelor's major is in E.C.E with a specialization in Avionics from the Indian Institute of Space science and Technology, where I, along with a few other students, founded the AI group of IIST. My final year thesis on developing deep generative model architectures for applications in data hiding has been recognized by the Indian National Academy of Engineering and was conferred with the "Best innovative computer science BTech thesis" award in India. I received a prestigious national award for work in data hiding. I also received a full-tuition scholarship from the Department of Space, Govt. of India, for undergraduate studies.
