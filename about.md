I am currently working as a Scientist at the National Remote Sensing Center, Indian Space Research Organization. My primary research interests are generative adversarial networks, deep learning theory, computer vision, and neural network architecture design. At ISRO, I design and develope solutions for remote sensing applications. My major projects involve [RTC-GAN for semantic segmentation of satellite images, NLP solutions for smart search in bhoonidhi, Advanced Disaster Monitoring Tool, and Automatic Product Quality Evaluation Software.](https://RohitGandikota.github.io/projects/).  

I received my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering with a specialization in Avionics from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/). The courses I've taken here at IIST, including Calculus, Statistics, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, and Deep Learning, helped me understand machine learning algorithms' fundamental working and mathematical formulations.

Upon graduation, I joined National Remote Sensing Center, Indian Space Research Organization as a Scientist. My main research focuses on:
- Developing solutions for remote sensing applications like road detection, cloud & water layer generation, land use land cover classification, ship detection, etc., using deep learning approaches. Achieved a testing accuracy of 91% over Indian remote sensing satellites, a first of it's kind. 
- Time series analysis and EDA to analyze the production chain of satellite image generation and modelling optimization techniques for improving the efficiency by factor of ~20. 
- Advanced image processing algorithms for automatic satellite image quality assessment. 
- NLP solutions for voice based smart interactive search and ordering of satellite images from ISRO's open data portal, Bhoonidhi. Provided an API package for the same on PyPI
