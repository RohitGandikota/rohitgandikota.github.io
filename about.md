Hi, I am a Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City](https://www.kansascityfed.org/).

I graduated in the spring of 2020 with a Master of Arts in Economics student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/) . I have a Bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).  
  
So far, I have worked on projects which have two things in common: they all involve a good level of programming challenges, and eventually can be linked to social science theory and applications. I have been fortunate enough to be able to get to work on such [interesting projects](https://10avinash.github.io/projects/).
